# Subsetting     

**Subset notation:**   
 1. Name of the R object    
 2. Square brackets `[ ]`      
 3. The index of the element     
 
  * The index tells R which elements from that object to include.   
  * Every dimension of the R object needs an index! This means a vector, which is a one dimensional R object would require only one index. A two dimensional R object such as a data frame or a matrix would require an index for rows and another for the columns.     
  * For two dimensional objects, first index (the on the left) in the brackets specifies the rows and the second specifies the columns.    


**There are four main ways to subset R objects**   
 1. Integers  
 2. Blank spaces   
 3. Names   
 4. Logical vectors (TRUE and FALSE)   

## 1. Integers
Positive integers behave just like *ij* notation in linear algebra.

Lets work with an example data frame `df` inspired from the Beatles.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(name=c("John","Paul","George","Ringo"),
                 birth=c(1940, 1942, 1943, 1940),
                 insturment=c("guitar", "bass","guitar","drums") )
df

```

The following gives the element in 2nd row and 3rd column.

```{r}
df[2,3]
```


### Multiple integers to subset

By giving vectors as indices, we can also get multiple rows and columns, giving multiple elements.

The following gives the elements that are in 2nd and 4th rows and the 3rd column.

```{r}
df[c(2,4),3]
```

The following gives the elements that are in 2nd & 4th rows and 2nd & 3rd columns.

```{r}
df[c(2,4),c(2,3)]

```

When selecting a series of rows and columns in a sequential manner, `:` becomes very handy.    
(Remember: `start:end` gives us a sequence of integers. For example `1:10` gives a vector of integers from 1 to 10.)
  
Select rows from 1 to 3 and columns from 1 to 2.

```{r}
df[1:3, 1:2]
```

### Repeating integers

Also repeating input repeats output.   
```{r}  
df[c(1,1,1,2,2), 1:3]
```

Do you see those unusual row numbers? It is because rownames or numbers has to be unique. When rows are repeated, R introduces secondary numbers to deal with this issue in its own way.     
      
### Integer `0`      

As an index, **zero will return nothing** from a dimension. This creates an empty object.

```{r}
df[1:2,0]
```

### Negative integers
Negative integers return **everything but** the elements at the specified locations.    
You cannot use both negative and positive integers in the same dimension     

Exclude rows 2 to 4 and select columns 2 to 3.
```{r}
df[-c(2:4), 2:3]
```

Exclude rows 2 to 4 and select columns 2 to 3.
```{r}
df[-c(2:4), 2:3]
```

## 2. Blank Spaces
Blank spaces return **everything**
(i.e., no subsetting occurs on that dimension)
  
```{r}
vec <- c(6,1,3,6,10,5)
vec[]
```

Return every element on row 1
```{r}
df[1,]
```

Return every element on column 2
```{r}
df[,2]
```

## 3. Names

If your object has names, you can ask for elements or columns back by name. (We talked about this in the first session)

```{r}
names(vec) <- c("a","b","c","d","e","f")
vec
```
Now I can call elements in `vec` by their names

```{r}
vec[c("a","b","d")]
```
Same applies to columns and column names

```{r}
df[ ,"birth"]
df[ ,c("name","birth")]
```

## 4. Logical

You can subset with a logical vector of the **same length as the dimension** you are subsetting. Each element that corresponds to a TRUE will be returned.

The following will return 2nd, 4th and 5th elements in `vec`
```{r}
vec[c(FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE)]
```

The following will return **2nd, 3rd rows** in `df`
```{r}
df[c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE), ]
```

## Subsetting Lists
Subsetting lists can get tricky, since a list can contain objects that has one or more dimensions.

```{r}
lst <- list(c(1,2), TRUE, c("a", "b", "c"))
lst
```

What is the difference?

```{r, eval=F}
lst[c(1,2)]  # outputs a list with 2 objects
lst[1]       # outputs a list with 1 object
lst[[1]]     # outputs a vector
```
```{r, eval=T}
lst[c(1,2)]  # outputs a list with 2 objects
lst[1]       # outputs a list with 1 object
lst[[1]]     # outputs a vector
```

Think this way: If list `x` is a train carrying objects, then `x[[5]]` is the *object* in car 5, whereas x[5] is a train with car 5 only.

### Easiest way to subset data frames and lists: `$` sign

The most common syntax for subsetting lists and data frames:

When we have a names list such as
```{r}
names(lst) <- c("alpha", "beta", "gamma")
lst
```

then we can subset objects with `$`
```{r}
lst$alpha
lst$beta
lst$gamma
```

It also works to subset columns of a data frame 

```{r}
df$birth
```

A nice shortcut: if you can't remember all the names in your list or columns in your data frame, you can simply tap `Tab` button and you can see the list. 

# R Packages

 * A collection of code and functions written for the R language.   
    
 * Usually focuses on a specific task or problem.   
    
 * Most of the useful R applications appear in packages.   
 
 * You need to install a package only **one time** using `install.packages()` function.    
 For example simply type `install.packages("ggplot2")` to the R console to install the `ggplot2` package.

 * **You cannot use a function in a package until you load the package!**

 * If you want to use the functions or data that comes with a certain package, you need to load that package **every time** you start an R session. To load a package you can use the `library()` package.   
 For example simply type `library(ggplot2)` to the R console to load the `ggplot2` package.
 
 * It is wise to add the packages you will use at the beginning of you R script -- so if you ever share that script with someone else or if you ever forget that certain functions you used in the script belong to a certain package, you can remember which packages you used by looking at the beginning of your code.

## Your turn
Install these packages : `ggplot2`, `maps`, `RColorBrewer`

```{r}
# install.packages(c("ggplot2", "maps", "RColorBrewer"))
library("ggplot2")
library("maps")
library("RColorBrewer")
```

# Diamonds data


```{r}
# assign diamonds
diamonds <- data.frame(diamonds)
```

Look at your environent, you can see the `diamonds` data is huge.   
 
 * Use subsetting to look at just the first six rows of diamonds     
 * Challenge: use subsetting to look at just the last six rows
 
Subsetting first 6 rows is easy
```{r}
# first 6 rows
diamonds[1:6,]
```

Last 6 is a little tricky
```{r}
# last 6 rows
dim(diamonds)
ncol(diamonds) # number of columns

#one way
nrow(diamonds) # number of rows
nrow(diamonds) - 6
diamonds[53934:53940,]

# another way
diamonds[(nrow(diamonds)-6):nrow(diamonds),]
```

Easiest way to check the first and last 5 rows
```{r}
head(diamonds) 
tail(diamonds) 
```


**View**
The `View()` function can also help you examine a data set, it opens a spreadsheet like data viewer.
```{r, eval=F}
View(diamonds) # notice: Capital V
```

**Help pages**
You can open the help page for any R object (including functions) by typing `?` followed by the object's name
```{r, eval=F}
?diamonds
```


# Logical tests

## Logical comparisons
What will these return?
```{r} 
1< 3
1> 3
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) > 3
```

```{r, echo=F, results='hold'}
logTable <- data.frame(Operator=c("x > y",
                                  "x >= y",
                                  "x < y",
                                  "x <= y",
                                  "x == y",
                                  "x != y",
                                  "x %in% c(y,z)"),
                       Tests=c("is x greater than y?",
                               "is x greater than or equal to y?",
                               "is x less than y?",
                               "is x less than or equal to y?",
                               "is x equal to y?",
                               "is x not equal to y?",
                               "is x in the set c(y,z)?"), stringsAsFactors = F)

library(knitr)
kable(logTable, caption = "Logical Operators")
```

## `%in%`
What does this do?
```{r, eval=F}
1 %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4)
1 %in% c(2, 3, 4)
c(3,4,5,6) %in% c(2, 3, 4)
```

`%in%` tests whether the object on the left is a member of the group on the right.
```{r, eval=T}
1 %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4)
1 %in% c(2, 3, 4)
c(3,4,5,6) %in% c(2, 3, 4)
```

## Boolean operators
You can combine logical tests with `&`, `|`, `xor`, `!`, `any`, and `all`

```{r, echo=F, results='hold'}
oprTable <- data.frame(Operator = c("a & b",
                                    "a | b",
                                    "xor(a,b)",
                                    "!(a)",
                                    "any(a,b,c)",
                                    "all(a,b,c)"),
                       Tests = c("both a and b are TRUE",
                                 "at least one of a and b is TRUE (or)",
                                 "a is TRUE or b is TRUE, but not both",
                                 "not a (TRUE goes to FALSE, FALSE goes to TRUE)",
                                 "at least one of a, b, or c is TRUE",
                                 "each of a, b, and c is TRUE" ), stringsAsFactors = F)

kable(oprTable, caption = "Boolean Operators")

```


### Your turn

```{r}
w <- c(-1, 0, 1)
x <- c(5, 15)
y <- "February"
z <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Friday")
```

**Questions**   

 * Is w positive?    
 * Is x greater than 10 and less than 20? Is object y the word February?    
 * Is every value in z a day of the week?     
 

**Common mistakes**
```{r, eval=F}
x > 10 & < 20
y = "February"
all(z == "Monday" | "Tuesday" | "Wednesday"...)
```


# Logical subsetting

Combining logical tests with subsetting is a very powerful technique! It is very commonly used to subset, clean and manipulate data.
```{r}
x_zeroes <- diamonds$x == 0
head(x_zeroes)
```

What will this return?
```{r}
diamonds[x_zeroes, ]
```

## Saving results

This will print to screen
```{r}
diamonds[diamonds$x > 10, ]
```


This will save to new data frame
```{r}
big <- diamonds[diamonds$x > 10, ]
```


This will overwrite the existing data frame. **Dangerous! Don't do it if you don't have to! Think twice!**
```{r, eval=F}
diamonds <- diamonds[diamonds$x < 10,]
```

# Missing values  
Typically removing the entire row because of one error is overkill.
Better to selectively replace problem values with missing values.
In R, missing values are indicated by `NA`

## NA Behavior   

 * Missing values propagate   
 * Use `is.na()` to check for missing values    
 
```{r} 
a <- c(1, NA)
a == NA
is.na(a)
```

 * Many functions (e.g. `sum` and `mean`) have `na.rm` argument to remove missing values prior to computation.
 
```{r}
b <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, NA)
sum(b)
sum(b, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Assigning `NA`
You can use subset notation with <- to change individual values within an object.
Here's an example with `diamonds`

Our x-y plot from `diamonds` before removing outliers
```{r}
qplot(x, y, data = diamonds)
```

**Now, let's remove outliers!**

Let's start figuring out what's wrong with `x`.
```{r}
summary(diamonds$x)
```

Minimum of `x` is zero?! But `x` is supposed to be the lenght of the diamond, it can't be `0`. Afterall, a diamond is a 3D object in real life!

How many zeros does `x` have?
```{r}
diamonds$x[diamonds$x == 0]
```

Ok not that many, we can assign `NA`s to `0`s to let `qplot` know that these are missing values
```{r}
diamonds$x[diamonds$x == 0] <- NA  
```
 
Now `0`s should be gone from the `Min.` and we should have `NA`s
```{r}
summary(diamonds$x)
```


Now let's clean `y`!
```{r}
summary(diamonds$y)
```

Again, y shouldn't be `0` because it's the width. So we can assign `NA` to `0`s to let `qplot` know that these are missing values!
```{r}
diamonds$y[diamonds$y == 0] <- NA
```

Some of the `y` values are really large compared to `x`. Probably some of those are outliers as well.
```{r}
y_big <- diamonds$y > 20 
diamonds$y[y_big] <- NA
```

Now the outliers are assigned as NA!
```{r}
summary(diamonds$y)
```

Let's look at the plot once more with _relatively clean data_
```{r}
qplot(x, y, data = diamonds)
```

Clever `qplot` removed the missing values from our plot!
